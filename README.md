## üöÄ Projects

### Sentiment Analysis with Attention Mechanisms
Built a custom sentiment analysis architecture with attention mechanisms and Conv1D layers for long-text (lyrics) classification. Fine-tuned the klue/bert-base model and introduced emotion similarity-based evaluation metrics.

### Hardware-Optimized Matrix Multiplier
Designed a 32√ó32 matrix multiplier with parallel 4-MAC units, SRAM timing control, and pipeline optimization. Compared a weight-stationary systolic array and an adder-tree-based vector multiplier for matrix multiplication on Xilinx FPGAs.

### Generative Models Implementation
Developed and analyzed generative models (VAE, C-VAE, and Info-GAN) using PyTorch, optimizing conditional generation, reconstruction quality, and stability through advanced techniques like latent space enhancement and feature matching.

### RISC-V Pipelined Processor Design
Designed control logics of RISC-V 5-stage pipelined processor with hazard detection and data forwarding, extending a single-cycle CPU.
